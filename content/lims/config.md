# Project Configuration


The Opencell BioHotel Lims uses a number of different data sources.

To start the project locally, first install the vercel cli as detailed above.

Data is stored in cloud firestore, create a project and generate a set of credentials which are needed for the following environment variables.

- FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
- FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
- FIREBASE_API_KEY=
- FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=
- FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
- REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
- REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
- REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=


This will allow firebase to connect to your app.
