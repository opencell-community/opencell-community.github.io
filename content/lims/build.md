## ðŸ‘‰ Get Started
Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
Update your `.env` file with values for each environment variable
```
API_KEY=AIzaSyBkkFF0XhNZeWuDmOfEhsgdfX1VBG7WTas
etc ...
```

Install the Vercel CLI
```
npm install -g vercel
```
Link codebase to a Vercel project and run development server
```
vercel dev
```
When the above command completes you'll be able to view your website at `http://localhost:3000`.

_Note: You can run just the front-end with `npm run start`, but `vercel dev` also handles running your API endpoints (located in the `/api` directory)._
